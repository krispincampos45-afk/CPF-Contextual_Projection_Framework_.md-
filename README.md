A minimalist interpretation of quantum mechanics that resolves all foundational paradoxes (complementarity, delayed choice, quantum erasure, decoherence, Schrödinger’s cat) without collapse, retrocausality, many worlds, or observer-dependent reality.

Core idea: Quantum "paradoxes" are category errors arising from simultaneously applying structurally incompatible contextual projections on Hilbert space.

**No-Paradox Theorem**: All quantum paradoxes stem exclusively from mixing incompatible contextual frameworks.
